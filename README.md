# Node Express API for Product Management

This repository contains code for a Node.js Express API for managing products. It utilizes MongoDB as the database and Mongoose for object modeling.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js installed on your machine
- MongoDB Atlas account for connecting to the database
- Basic understanding of RESTful APIs and CRUD operations

## Setup

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install dependencies by running `npm install`.
3. Set up your MongoDB Atlas account and create a cluster.
4. Replace the MongoDB connection string in `app.js` with your own connection string.
5. Start the server by running `node app.js`.
6. The API will be running on port 3000 by default.

## Endpoints

- `GET /products`: Get all products.
- `GET /products/:id`: Get a specific product by ID.
- `POST /product`: Create a new product.
- `PUT /products/:id`: Update a product by ID.
- `DELETE /products/:id`: Delete a product by ID.

## Usage

- Use a tool like Postman or curl to interact with the API endpoints.
- Send requests to the appropriate endpoints using the HTTP methods mentioned above.
- Ensure the request body (if applicable) is in JSON format.

## Additional Notes

- This API is a basic example and can be extended with additional features such as authentication, validation, pagination, etc.
- Always handle errors gracefully and provide appropriate error messages in responses.
